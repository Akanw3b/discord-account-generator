# discord-account-generator
discord account generator
This script will create a Discord account for each email in the emails list using a random name as the username and a randomly generated password. The requests library is used to make HTTP requests to the Discord API.

To use the script, simply replace the emails in the emails list with your own list of emails, and then run the script. The accounts will be created automatically. Keep in mind that Discord's terms of service do not allow the creation of multiple accounts, so use this script at your own risk.
